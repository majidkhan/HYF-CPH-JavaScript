**Kind note:**

We expect you to **always** come prepared to the class on Sunday.

## Module goals:

### Week 1-3:

A basic program with multiple functions (reacting to user input)

### Week 4-6:

A tool capable of loading a JSON file and representing it in the DOM

### Week 7-9:

A web app with external data source using at least one API

### Overall

A good understanding of all the above mentioned topics. Want to check your Knowledge? Go through the [JavaScript Fundamentals README](/fundamentals) and research/ ask for help (Slack!) with the concepts that are not entirely clear.
